      <h1>Welcome to [arr]ange!</h1>
      <p>
        I hope this platform becomes your go-to tool for securing a job. Use it
        in whatever way works best for you. Hereâ€™s the approach Iâ€™ve found to be
        the most effective:
      </p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          <b>Identify Opportunities</b> â€“ Add companies that are actively hiring
          to your board.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Find Connections</b> â€“ Use LinkedIn to search for employees at
          those companies. (I aim for at least three per company.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Reach Out</b> â€“ Contact those employees through LinkedIn, X,
          Instagram, GitHub, or email â€” whatever works. Make sure your message
          is something you'd want to respond to.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Track Your Network</b> â€“ Add these contacts to your Contacts page
          and link them to their respective companies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Follow Up</b> â€“ If you donâ€™t hear back, donâ€™t be discouraged! This
          is a numbers game. Follow up after a few days to keep the conversation
          going.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Stay organized, stay resilient, and take control of your job search.
        Happy hunting! ðŸš€
      </p>
    </>
